.Sh NAME
.Nm pgrep
.Nd find processes
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm pgrep
.Op Fl filLnvVx
.Op Fl d Ar delim
.Op Fl g Ar pgrplist
.Op Fl G Ar gidlist
.Op Fl P Ar ppidlist
.Op Fl t Ar termlist
.Op Fl u Ar euidlist
.Op Fl U Ar uidlist
.Op Ar pattern
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility displays process IDs for those processes that match the requirements
specified on the command line.  The process IDs are presented as decimal numbers
separated by an optionally supplied delimiter, which defaults to a newline.
The output can optionally include the executable name
printed after the process ID, separated by a space.
.Pp
Processes are matched if the
.Ar pattern ,
if given, matches the process's name, and the process matches any of the
arguments given to all of the rest of the flags supplied on the command line.
The arguments supplied to
.Nm
can be given as a comma and/or whitespace delimited list.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d Ar delim
Use the specified delimiter to separate the process IDs instead of a newline.
.It Fl f
Match the
.Ar pattern
anywhere in the full argument string of the process instead
of just the executable name.
.It Fl g Ar pgrplist
Match only processes that exist within the process groups specified.
.It Fl G Ar gidlist
Match only processes whose real group ID is listed.  Group IDs can be specified
as group names and numeric IDs.  Non-existent numeric IDs do not cause errors.
.It Fl i
Use case-insensitive pattern matching.
.It Fl l
Print the executable name of the process along with the process ID.
.It Fl L
Print the full argument string of the process along with the process ID.
.It Fl n
Print only the latest process that matches the rest of the arguments.  That is,
the process that has the most recent start time.
.It Fl P Ar ppidlist
Match only processes whose parent process ID is specified.
.It Fl t Ar termlist
Match only processes whose controlling terminal is specified.  Terminals can
be specified as children of the /dev directory or, if starting with a leading
slash (`/'), any currently mounted filename.  Filenames specified must be
character devices.
.It Fl u Ar euidlist
Match only processes whose effective user ID is given.  User IDs can be
specified as usernames and as numeric user IDs.
.It Fl U Ar uidlist
Match only processes whose real user ID is given.  User IDs can be specified as
usernames and as numeric user IDs.
.It Fl v
Invert the matching algorithm. Will print information about processes that do
not match the given arguments.
As an exception, combining the
.Fl n
option with the
.Fl v
option will not invert the
.Ar pattern
match (only flags will be inverted).
.It Fl V
Prints the
.Nm
version, then quits.
.It Fl x
Treat the
.Ar pattern
as a literal string for exact (full-string) matching. Without this option,
the default is to match as an extended regular expression.
N.b. the Solaris
.Nm pgrep
performs regular expression matching in the presence of the
.Fl x
option. This behaviour is considered redundant in this
.Nm
implementation. The same effect may be achieved by avoiding the
.Fl x
option and instead using a pattern of the form
.Ar ^(pattern)$ .
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Cm pgrep sendmail
.Pp
Prints the process IDs of all sendmail processes.
.Pp
.Cm pgrep -G daemon -v
.Pp
Prints the process IDs of all processes whose group ID is not daemon.
.Pp
.Cm pgrep -d, -u root sh
.Pp
Prints the process IDs of all shells whose effective user ID is root, separated
by commas.

Output with the
.Fl L
option may vary between operating systems.
.Pp
For the sysctl mode of operation (e.g. Darwin) the
.Fl L
option will list process belonging to other users but will be unable
to display details of their arguments. A question mark and executable
name (but not the argument string) will be displayed.
(The Darwin
.Nm ps
can show arguments because it is setuid root.)

.Nm
command appeared in Sun Solaris 7.
