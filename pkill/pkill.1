.Sh NAME
.Nm pkill
.Nd send signals to found processes
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm pkill
.Op Fl signal
.Op Fl fnvx
.Op Fl g Ar pgrplist
.Op Fl G Ar gidlist
.Op Fl P Ar ppidlist
.Op Fl s Ar signal
.Op Fl t Ar termlist
.Op Fl u Ar euidlist
.Op Fl U Ar uidlist
.Op Ar pattern
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility sends a signal to process IDs for those processes that match the
requirements specified on the command line.
.Pp
Processes are matched if the
.Ar pattern ,
if given, matches the process's name, and the process matches any of the
arguments given to all of the rest of the flags supplied on the command line.
The arguments supplied to
.Nm
can be given as a comma and/or whitespace delimited list.
When given no options,
.Nm
sends a signal to all user-mode processes.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl signal
Specifies the signal to be sent to the matched processes.  Defaults to SIGTERM.
The signal can be specified as the name, with or without the prepended `SIG',
or as a number.  This is a deprecated way to specify options, but exists to
match the
.Xr kill 1
command.  When specified, it must appear as the first argument to
.Nm pkill .
.It Fl f
Match the pattern given against the full argument string of the process instead
of just the executable name.
.It Fl g Ar pgrplist
Match only processes that exist within the process groups specified.
.It Fl G Ar gidlist
Match only processes whose real group ID is listed.  Group IDs can be specified
as group names and numeric IDs.  Non-existant numeric IDs do not cause errors.
.It Fl l
Print the executable name of the process along with the process ID.
.It Fl n
Print only the latest process that matches the rest of the arguments.  That is,
the process that has the most recent start time.
.It Fl P Ar ppidlist
Match only processes whose parent process ID is specified.
.It Fl s Ar signal
Specifies the signal to be sent to the matched processes.  Defaults to SIGTERM.
The signal can be specified as the name, with or without the prepended `SIG',
or as a number.
.It Fl t Ar termlist
Match only processes whose controlling terminal is specified.  Terminals can
be specified as children of the /dev directory or, if starting with a leading
slash (`/'), any currently mounted filename.  Filenames specified must be
character devices.
.It Fl u Ar euidlist
Match only processes whose effective user ID is given.  User IDs can be
specified as usernames and as numeric user IDs.
.It Fl U Ar uidlist
Match only processes whose real user ID is given.  User IDs can be specified as
usernames and as numeric user IDs.
.It Fl v
Invert the matching algorithm to print information about process that do not
match the given arguments.
.It Fl x
Make the pattern match be an exact match instead of a regular expression.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Cm pkill sendmail
.Pp
Sends a SIGTERM signal to all sendmail processes.
.Pp
.Cm pkill -G daemon -v
.Pp
Sends a SIGTERM signal to all processes whose group ID is not daemon.
.Pp
.Cm pkill -9 -u root sh
.Pp
or
.Pp
.Cm pkill -u root -s 9 sh
.Pp
Sends signal 9 (SIGKILL) to all shells whose effective user ID is root.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr pgrep 1 ,
.Xr ps 1 ,
.Xr regex 3
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in Sun Solaris 7.
.Sh BUGS
The original Solaris pkill could also match against session ID, but OpenBSD's
session ID can fail to exist if the session leader exits.
.Pp
Also, the original Solaris version had only the deprecated
.Fl signal
option to specify what signal to send.  This version can also use the
.Fl s Ar signal
option, which subsumes the session ID match listed above.
.Pp
It is possible for pkill to kill itself.
