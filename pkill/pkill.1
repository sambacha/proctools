.Sh NAME
.Nm pkill
.Nd send signals to found processes
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm pkill
.Op Fl signal
.Op Fl finvVx
.Op Fl g Ar pgrplist
.Op Fl G Ar gidlist
.Op Fl P Ar ppidlist
.Op Fl s Ar signal
.Op Fl t Ar termlist
.Op Fl u Ar euidlist
.Op Fl U Ar uidlist
.Op Ar pattern
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility sends a signal to process IDs for those processes that match the
requirements specified on the command line.
.Pp
Processes are matched if the
.Ar pattern ,
if given, matches the process's name, and the process matches any of the
arguments given to all of the rest of the flags supplied on the command line.
The arguments supplied to
.Nm
can be given as a comma and/or whitespace delimited list.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl signal
Specifies the signal to be sent to the matched processes.  Defaults to SIGTERM.
The signal can be specified as the name, with or without the prepended `SIG',
or as a number.  This is a deprecated way to specify options, but exists to
match the
.Xr kill 1
command.  When specified, it must appear as the first argument to
.Nm pkill .
.It Fl f
Match the
.Ar pattern
anywhere in the full argument string of the process instead
of just the executable name.
.It Fl g Ar pgrplist
Match only processes that exist within the process groups specified.
.It Fl G Ar gidlist
Match only processes whose real group ID is listed.  Group IDs can be specified
as group names and numeric IDs.  Non-existent numeric IDs do not cause errors.
.It Fl i
Use case-insensitive pattern matching.
.It Fl l
Print the executable name of the process along with the process ID.
.It Fl n
Print only the latest process that matches the rest of the arguments.  That is,
the process that has the most recent start time.
.It Fl P Ar ppidlist
Match only processes whose parent process ID is specified.
.It Fl s Ar signal
Specifies the signal to be sent to the matched processes.  Defaults to SIGTERM.
The signal can be specified as the name, with or without the prepended `SIG',
or as a number.
Signals need not be preceded with a minus sign, but it is allowed.
.It Fl t Ar termlist
Match only processes whose controlling terminal is specified.  Terminals can
be specified as children of the /dev directory or, if starting with a leading
slash (`/'), any currently mounted filename.  Filenames specified must be
character devices.
.It Fl u Ar euidlist
Match only processes whose effective user ID is given.  User IDs can be
specified as usernames and as numeric user IDs.
.It Fl U Ar uidlist
Match only processes whose real user ID is given.  User IDs can be specified as
usernames and as numeric user IDs.
.It Fl v
Invert the matching algorithm. Will print information about processes that do
not match the given arguments.
As an exception, combining the
.Fl n
option with the
.Fl v
option will not invert the
.Ar pattern
match (only flags will be inverted).
.It Fl V
Prints the
.Nm
version, then quits.
.It Fl x
Treat the
.Ar pattern
as a literal string for exact (full-string) matching. Without this option,
the default is to match as an extended regular expression.
N.b. the Solaris
.Nm pgrep
performs regular expression matching in the presence of the
.Fl x
option. This behaviour is considered redundant in this
.Nm
implementation. The same effect may be achieved by avoiding the
.Fl x
option and instead using a pattern of the form
.Ar ^(pattern)$ .
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Cm pkill sendmail
.Pp
Sends a SIGTERM signal to all sendmail processes.
.Pp
.Cm pkill -G daemon -v
.Pp
Sends a SIGTERM signal to all processes whose group ID is not daemon.
.Pp
.Cm pkill -9 -u root sh
.Pp
or
.Pp
.Cm pkill -u root -s 9 sh
.Pp
Sends signal 9 (SIGKILL) to all shells whose effective user ID is root.

.so ../proctools/man.notes
.Pp
If a process has changed its displayed argument string, the
.Fl f
option can be used to match against that string. Otherwise,
the match will be performed against the executable name.
