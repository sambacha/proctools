.Sh BUGS
The original Solaris
.Nm
could also match against session ID, but OpenBSD's
session ID can fail to exist if the session leader exits.
.Pp
Also, the original Solaris version had only the deprecated
.Fl signal
option to specify what signal to send.  This version can also use the
.Fl s Ar signal
option, which subsumes the session ID match listed above.
