.Sh NOTES
The current
.Nm
process will not consider itself to be a potential match. However, it is
possible for a user to construct a shell pipeline that contains processes
that will be matched by the
.Ar pattern
supplied to this tool. Some users might not anticipate this.
.Pp
The output of this tool should never be treated as accurate programmatic input
(process arguments will have been escaped for safe printing on the terminal).
