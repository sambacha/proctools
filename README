Proctools:
pgrep, pkill and pfind for OpenBSD and Darwin (Mac OS X)

The proctools are text-based utilities to scan for and send signals to
processes.

The project homepage is <http://sourceforge.net/projects/proctools>. The
proctools are distributed under the terms of the BSD license. Feedback may
be sent to j-devenish and wfaulk at the users.sourceforge.net e-mail domain.

Proctools provides three executables and three man pages. To compile for
OpenBSD, run `make .MAIN install`. If your OpenBSD is old and compilation
fails due to the absence of KVM_NO_FILES, try `make OLDKVM=1 .MAIN install`.
For Darwin, run `bsdmake .MAIN install`.
